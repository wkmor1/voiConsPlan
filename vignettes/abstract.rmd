========

Spatial conservation plans are typically based on uncertain inputs and additional data may improve them. Value of information analysis indicates how beneficial new information is to delivering a better outcome in a decision problem. However, the toolset of spatial conservation prioritization does not yet contain a method for assessing the value of new information to a spatial conservation plan. If the value of information could be calculated, then we would know the benefit from the optimal allocation of effort to gather new information. Here, for the first time we demonstrate how a formal value of information analysis can be applied to a spatial conservation plan. We show how a value of information analysis can be combined with traditional conservation planning tools to determine the benefit of information on species distributions and optimize a reserve network to protect them. We incorporate uncertainty into conservation planning with Monte Carlo sampling of the planning inputs and then test the effects of uncertainty reduction to calculate the value of additional information to a conservation plan. The impact of optimally incorporating new information into conservation plans, will reduce the loss of resources spent on unnecessary information gathering where new data has no or little benefit to the fundamental objectives of the plan.
