========

Spatial conservation plans are typically based upon uncertain inputs and may benefit from additional data to inform them. Value of informaiton analysis indicates how beneficial new information is to a decision problem. However, the toolset of spatial conservation prioritization does not yet contain a method for assessing the value of new information to a spatial conservation plan. If the value of information were to be calculated, then any given conservation plan could be more effective, benefiting from a more optimal allocation of effort to incorporating new information. Here, for the first time we demonstrate how a formal value of information analysis can be applied to a spatial conservation plan. We show how a value of information analysis can be combined with traditional conservation planning tools to map species distributions and optimize a reserve network to protect them. We incorporate uncertainty into conservation planning with Monte Carlo sampling of the planning inputs and then test the effects of uncertainty reduction to calculate the value of additional information to a conservation plan. The impact of optimally incorporating additional information into conservation plans, will be more effective plans where additional information is beneficial, and avoiding the loss of resources to unnecessary information gathering where new data has no or little benefit to the fundamental objectives of the plan.
