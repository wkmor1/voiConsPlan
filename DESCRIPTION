Description: What is the value of information when doing spatial conservation
    planning? The inputs of a spatial conservation plan can be uncertain. There
    are many types of uncertainty in a spatial conservation plan. To create a
    conservation plan with a greater expected outcome it may be worth reducing the
    uncertainty of inputs before prioritizing. But which uncertainties should be
    addressed and by how much? The concept of 'value of information' can guide how
    to address uncertainty in a decision problem. Here we introduce the application
    of an expected value of information analysis for spatial conservation planning
    for the first time.
