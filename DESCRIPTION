Description: Spatial conservation plans are typically based upon uncertain
    inputs and may benefit from additional data to inform them.However, the
    toolset of spatial prioritization does not yet contain a method for
    assessing the value of new information to a spatial conservation plan.
    If the value of information were to be calculated, then conservation plans
    would more effective, benefiting from a more optimal amount of information.
    Here, for the first time we demonstrate how a formal value of information
    analysis can be applied to a spatial conservation plan. We show how a value
    of information analysis can be combined with traditional conservation
    planning tools to map species distributions and optimize a reserve network
    to protect them. We incorporate uncertainty into conservation planning with
    Monte Carlo sampling of the planning inputs and then test the effects of
    uncertainty reduction to calculate the value of additional information to a
    conservation plan. The impact of optimally incorporating additional
    information into conservation plans, will be more effective plans where
    additional information is beneficial, and avoiding the loss of resources to
    uneccessary information gathering where new data has no benefit to the
    fundemental objectives of the plan.
